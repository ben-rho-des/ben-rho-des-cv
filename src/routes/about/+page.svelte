  <p>Hey, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹</p>
  <p>I'm a full-stack developer who loves building things that actually make a difference. Right now, I'm focused on solidifying myself as a tech lead, leveling up my UI chops, and pushing forward into technical leadership while experimenting with new ideas and products.</p>
  <p>But I'm not just about code. I'm a DIY enthusiast currently transforming a shipping container into a home office/studio â€” lovingly nicknamed the "work womb." I get a huge kick out of strategy games like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, and Marvel Snap (studying the meta and different playstyles is basically brain yoga for me).</p>
  <p>Outside of work, you'll probably find me cooking (Mexican and Italian are my go-tos), hanging out with my partner Elly, cat Otis and dog Ace. Long term, I've got big dreams of moving somewhere more remote to live a little slower and create a little more.</p>
  <p>At the heart of everything, my values stay pretty simple:</p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
    <li>Be myself</li>
    <li>Stay optimistic</li>
    <li>Have fun and bring light where I can</li>
    <li>Foster safe, supportive spaces</li>
    <li>Care deeply about what I work on</li>
  </ul>

  <p>That's me in a nutshell â€” coding, creating, cooking, and always curious about what's next.</p>
